## What's New

### [0.4.1] — September 2026
- **`check_indexing_issues` runs concurrently** — same fix as #31, so it no longer times out on 10-URL batches against `sc-domain:*` properties. Thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph). (#55)
- **Removed a leftover dead `orderBy`** in `get_search_by_page_query` (the Search Analytics API ignores it). Thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph). (#55)

### [0.4.0] — September 2026
- **Rich-result issues now surface** — `inspect_url_enhanced` and `batch_url_inspection` read rich-result issues from the correct API path, so markup problems are reported instead of silently dropped. Thanks [@patrickweh](https://github.com/patrickweh). (#46, #48)
- **`batch_url_inspection` runs concurrently** — 10-URL batches no longer time out on `sc-domain:*` properties. Thanks [@remotesensei](https://github.com/remotesensei). (#31)
- **`compare_search_periods` deltas fixed** — Period 1 is now the analyzed period and Period 2 the baseline, so growth reads as growth (not decline). Thanks [@JKdreaming](https://github.com/JKdreaming). (#42)
- **`get_advanced_search_analytics` sorting works** — `sort_by`/`sort_direction` are now applied instead of silently ignored. Thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph). (#54)
- **Hardened error handling** — replaced bare `except:` clauses so fatal signals aren't swallowed. Thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph). (#53)
- **Note:** `batch_url_inspection` renames the per-URL `verdict` field to `index_verdict` to distinguish it from the rich-result verdict.

### [0.3.3] — July 2026
- **Fixed fresh installs broken by `mcp` 2.0** — pinned `mcp[cli]<2.0.0`. The `mcp` SDK 2.0.0 (released 2026-07-28) removed the `mcp.server.fastmcp` module, so every fresh `uvx mcp-search-console` install crashed on startup with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp.server.fastmcp'`. New installs now resolve a working 1.x SDK again — no `--with "mcp<2"` workaround needed.

### [0.3.2] — April 2026
- **OAuth browser flow fixed for uvx** — removed the `isatty` block that prevented the browser login window from opening when running as an MCP subprocess on macOS. OAuth now works out of the box with `uvx`, no manual terminal run needed.
- **`get_capabilities` tool added** — call this to get a full list of available tools and current auth status in one shot. Useful when your AI assistant isn't sure what tools are available.
- **Better auth error messages** — all tools now tell you exactly what to do when credentials are missing or expired.

## Getting Started

### Step 1 — Set Up Google API Credentials

You need credentials before configuring any client. Pick one method:

#### Option A — OAuth (Recommended — uses your own Google account)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create or select a project
2. [Enable the Search Console API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/searchconsole.googleapis.com)
3. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → Create Credentials → **OAuth client ID**
4. Configure the OAuth consent screen, select **Desktop app**, click Create
5. Download the JSON file — save it somewhere permanent (e.g. `~/Documents/client_secrets.json`)

On first use, a browser window will open asking you to sign in to your Google account. After that, the token is saved and no browser interaction is needed again.

#### Option B — Service Account (For automation or team use)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create or select a project
2. [Enable the Search Console API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/searchconsole.googleapis.com)
3. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → Create Credentials → **Service Account**
4. Go to the Keys tab → Add Key → Create new key → JSON → Download
5. Save the file somewhere permanent (e.g. `~/Documents/service_account.json`)
6. Add the service account email to your GSC property: Search Console → Settings → Users and permissions → Add user → Full access

  </a>
</div>

*Updated 2026 — covers the full installation process using the new uvx method, from setting up your Google credentials to your first successful query.*

---

### Step 2 — Installation

#### Option A — uvx (Recommended)

No cloning, no Python installation, no virtual environments. `uvx` downloads and runs the server automatically and keeps it up to date.

**Install uv** — open Terminal and run all three commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Download and install
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2. Activate in the current Terminal session
source $HOME/.local/bin/env

# 3. Make it permanent for all future sessions
echo 'source $HOME/.local/bin/env' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Verify:
```bash
uv --version
```

> **Why all three commands?** The installer puts `uv` in `~/.local/bin`, but your already-open Terminal session doesn't know about that folder yet. Step 2 activates it immediately. Step 3 ensures every future Terminal window has it automatically.

Now configure your AI client:

---

**Claude Desktop**

Config file: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

OAuth:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gscServer": {
      "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-search-console"],
      "env": {
        "GSC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE": "/full/path/to/client_secrets.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Service Account:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gscServer": {
      "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-search-console"],
      "env": {
        "GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH": "/full/path/to/service_account.json",
        "GSC_SKIP_OAUTH": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

**Cursor**

Config file: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

OAuth:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gscServer": {
      "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-search-console"],
      "env": {
        "GSC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE": "/full/path/to/client_secrets.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

**Codex CLI**

Config file: `~/.codex/config.toml`

OAuth:
```toml
[mcp_servers.gscServer]
command = "/FULL/PATH/TO/uvx"
args = ["mcp-search-console"]
enabled = true
env = { GSC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE = "/full/path/to/client_secrets.json" }
```

Service Account:
```toml
[mcp_servers.gscServer]
command = "/FULL/PATH/TO/uvx"
args = ["mcp-search-console"]
enabled = true
env = { GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH = "/full/path/to/service_account.json", GSC_SKIP_OAUTH = "true" }
```

---

> **Finding your uvx path:** On macOS/Linux run `which uvx` in Terminal after installing uv (typically `/Users/YOUR_NAME/.local/bin/uvx`). On Windows, run `Get-Command uvx | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source` in PowerShell (or `where uvx` in cmd) — it's usually `C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.local\bin\uvx.exe`. Replace `/FULL/PATH/TO/uvx` in the configs above with that path.
>
> **Why the full path?** GUI apps like Claude Desktop and Cursor launch without reading your shell config (`~/.zshrc`), so they don't know about `~/.local/bin`. Using the full path guarantees it works regardless of how the app is launched. If you see a `spawn uvx ENOENT` error, this is the fix.

After saving the config, **fully quit the app (`Cmd+Q`) and reopen it**.

For OAuth: on first use, a browser window will open automatically for login. After that, the token is cached and you won't be asked again.

---

#### Option B — Clone (Advanced)

**Prefer a video walkthrough for this method?** The tutorial below covers the clone install path step by step — virtual environment setup, dependencies, and config:

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://youtu.be/PCWsK5BgSd0">
    <img src="assets/gsc-mcp-seo-video-2.jpg" alt="Google Search Console API Setup Tutorial" width="600" style="margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
  </a>
</div>

Use this if you want to modify the code or run a specific local version. This method uses the video tutorial above for the credential setup steps.

> **Requires Python 3.11+.** This server will not start on Python 3.10 or older — and when it's launched by a GUI client like Claude Desktop, it fails silently (no tools appear and no log file is written). Check your version with `python --version`. If it's below 3.11, install [Python 3.11 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and recreate your virtual environment. The uvx method (Option A) avoids this entirely by managing the Python version for you, so it's the recommended path on Windows.

**Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AminForou/mcp-gsc.git
cd mcp-gsc
```

Or download the ZIP from the green Code button at the top of this page and unzip it.

**Set up the environment:**
```bash
uv venv .venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Configure your AI client** (Claude Desktop example):

OAuth:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gscServer": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/mcp-gsc/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/mcp-gsc/gsc_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "GSC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE": "/full/path/to/client_secrets.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Service Account:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gscServer": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/mcp-gsc/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/mcp-gsc/gsc_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH": "/full/path/to/service_account.json",
        "GSC_SKIP_OAUTH": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Mac path examples:
- Python: `/Users/yourname/Documents/mcp-gsc/.venv/bin/python`
- Script: `/Users/yourname/Documents/mcp-gsc/gsc_server.py`

---

### Step 3 — Test

Ask your AI assistant: **"List my GSC properties"**

If you see your properties — it's working. If not, ask: **"Call get_capabilities"** to see auth status and diagnose the issue.

---

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GSC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE` | OAuth only | — | Absolute path to your OAuth client secrets JSON. Always required when using `uvx`. |
| `GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH` | Service account only | — | Absolute path to your service account JSON key. Always required when using `uvx`. |
| `GSC_SKIP_OAUTH` | No | `false` | Set to `"true"` to force service account auth and skip OAuth entirely |
| `GSC_DATA_STATE` | No | `"all"` | `"all"` matches the GSC dashboard. `"final"` returns only confirmed data (2–3 day lag). |
| `GSC_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE` | No | `false` | Set to `"true"` to enable add/delete site and delete sitemap tools |

---

## Cursor Marketplace

One-click install available — search for `mcp-search-console` in the Cursor Marketplace.

After installing, configure your credentials (see Step 1 above) then use the bundled skills directly in Cursor Agent chat:

| Skill | How to invoke | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `seo-weekly-report` | *"Run the SEO weekly report for example.com"* | Full 28-day performance summary with period-over-period comparison and top queries |
| `cannibalization-check` | *"Check for keyword cannibalization on example.com"* | Finds queries where multiple pages compete; recommends which to keep |
| `indexing-audit` | *"Audit indexing for my top pages"* | Batch-inspects top 20 pages and returns a prioritized fix list |
| `content-opportunities` | *"Find content opportunities for example.com"* | Surfaces position-11-20 queries with high impressions and low CTR |

---

## Sample Prompts

| Tool | Sample Prompt |
|------|--------------|
| `list_properties` | "List all my GSC properties and tell me which ones have the most pages indexed." |
| `get_search_analytics` | "Show me the top 20 search queries for mywebsite.com in the last 30 days, highlight any with CTR below 2%, and suggest title improvements." |
| `get_performance_overview` | "Create a visual performance overview of mywebsite.com for the last 28 days, identify any unusual drops or spikes, and explain possible causes." |
| `check_indexing_issues` | "Check these pages for indexing issues: mywebsite.com/product, mywebsite.com/services, mywebsite.com/about" |
| `inspect_url_enhanced` | "Do a comprehensive inspection of mywebsite.com/landing-page and give me actionable recommendations." |
| `compare_search_periods` | "Compare my site's performance between January and February. What queries improved the most?" |
| `get_advanced_search_analytics` | "Analyze queries with high impressions but positions below 10, filtered to mobile traffic in the US only." |

---

## Troubleshooting

### `spawn uvx ENOENT` or `command not found: uvx`

Your AI client can't find `uvx`. Use the full path instead of just `uvx`:

```bash
# Find your full path (macOS/Linux):
which uvx
# Typically: /Users/YOUR_NAME/.local/bin/uvx
```

```powershell
# Find your full path (Windows PowerShell):
Get-Command uvx | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source
# Typically: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.local\bin\uvx.exe
```

Replace `"command": "uvx"` with the full path (e.g. `"command": "/Users/YOUR_NAME/.local/bin/uvx"`) in your config.

### `uv --version` gives "command not found" right after installing

The installer updates `~/.local/bin` but your current Terminal session doesn't see it yet. Run:

```bash
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

Then add it permanently:
```bash
echo 'source $HOME/.local/bin/env' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Authentication failed / credentials file not found

Make sure you are using the **absolute path** to your credentials file — not a relative path, not `~/`. Example:
```
/Users/yourname/Documents/client_secrets.json   ✅
~/Documents/client_secrets.json                 ✅
client_secrets.json                              ❌
```

### MCP only works in Claude Desktop app, not the website

The MCP server runs locally on your machine. It only works in the **Claude Desktop app** (downloaded from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)), not in the claude.ai browser interface.

### AI Client Configuration Issues

1. Make sure all file paths in your config are correct absolute paths
2. Fully quit (`Cmd+Q`) and reopen the app after any config change — just closing the window is not enough
3. Ask your AI assistant to "call get_capabilities" — it will report the exact auth status and error

---

## Safety: Destructive Operations

By default, `add_site`, `delete_site`, and `delete_sitemap` are disabled. To enable them:

```json
"GSC_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE": "true"
```

---

## Remote Deployment & Docker (Advanced)

The standard setup runs the server locally. This section is only for users who want to run it on a remote server or in a container.

### HTTP Transport

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=sse MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 MCP_PORT=3001 python gsc_server.py
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | Set to `sse` for network/remote use |
| `MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host to bind |
| `MCP_PORT` | `3001` | Port to bind |

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t mcp-gsc .

docker run \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=sse \
  -e MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_PORT=3001 \
  -e GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/app/credentials.json \
  -v /path/to/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  mcp-gsc
```

## Changelog

### [0.4.1] — September 2026
- `check_indexing_issues` now inspects URLs concurrently (same fix as #31), avoiding timeouts on full 10-URL batches against `sc-domain:*` properties. (Fixes #55; thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph))
- Removed a leftover `orderBy` from `get_search_by_page_query` — a dead field the Search Analytics API ignores, matching the #54 cleanup. (Fixes #55; thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph))

### [0.4.0] — September 2026
- Fixed rich-result issue reporting in `inspect_url_enhanced` and `batch_url_inspection` — issues are read from `detectedItems[].items[].issues[]` (`issueMessage`), the key the API actually returns, so problems are no longer silently dropped. (Fixes #46, #48; thanks [@patrickweh](https://github.com/patrickweh))
- `batch_url_inspection` now inspects URLs concurrently, so full 10-URL batches complete within the client timeout even on slower `sc-domain:*` properties. (Fixes #31; thanks [@remotesensei](https://github.com/remotesensei))
- `compare_search_periods` now computes deltas as Period 1 relative to Period 2 (Period 2 as the percentage baseline, positive = Period 1 better), with the direction documented. (Fixes #42; thanks [@JKdreaming](https://github.com/JKdreaming))
- `get_advanced_search_analytics` applies `sort_by`/`sort_direction` client-side instead of sending an `orderBy` the Search Analytics API ignores. (Fixes #54; thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph))
- Replaced three bare `except:` clauses with `except Exception:` so `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit` are no longer swallowed. (Fixes #53; thanks [@kuldiph](https://github.com/kuldiph))
- **Breaking:** `batch_url_inspection` renames the per-URL `verdict` field to `index_verdict`.

### [0.3.3] — July 2026
- Pinned `mcp[cli]>=1.3.0,<2.0.0`. The `mcp` SDK 2.0.0 removed `mcp.server.fastmcp`, breaking all fresh `uvx` installs with `ModuleNotFoundError`. Capping below 2.0 restores working installs. (Fixes #41)

### [0.3.2] — April 2026
- **OAuth browser flow fixed for uvx** — removed `isatty` block that prevented the OAuth browser window from opening when running as an MCP subprocess on macOS. OAuth + `uvx` now works out of the box.
- **`get_capabilities` tool** — returns all available tools grouped by category plus live auth status in one call.
- **Better auth error messages** — all tools now explicitly tell you to call `reauthenticate` when credentials are missing or expired.
- **Improved `list_properties` description** — better semantic tool discovery in clients that use lazy tool loading.

### [0.3.1] — April 2026
- Fixed `list_properties` masking real auth errors; fail-fast on missing credentials.

### [0.3.0] — April 2026
- Cursor Marketplace plugin with 4 bundled SEO skills
- Stable token storage in platform user config dir (survives `uvx` upgrades)
- Structured JSON output for all data tools
- 39 unit tests

### [0.2.2] — April 2026
- Safety mode for destructive tools (disabled by default)
- HTTP/SSE transport for remote deployments
- Dockerfile

### [0.2.1] — March 2026
- `reauthenticate` tool for switching Google accounts
- Fixed sitemap TypeError crash
- Fixed domain property 404 errors

### [0.2.0] — March 2026
- `dataState: "all"` by default (matches GSC dashboard)
- Flexible `row_limit` parameter (up to 500)
- Multi-dimension filtering for advanced analytics

### [0.1.0] — Initial release
- 19 tools covering property management, search analytics, URL inspection, and sitemap management
- OAuth and service account authentication
